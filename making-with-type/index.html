                <div class="body random a b">WE WANT TO SEE YOur mind. let us inside. our brain computer interface is fully implantable. so you wont even know we are there untill its too late. designed to let you control a computer or mobile device anywhere you go. will withstand physioloigical, biological and nerological conditiona, let us in and you will never get us out. I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate. All those moments will be lost in time... like tears in rain... Time to die. Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies, like rats leaving a sinking ship; then the ship... sinks. You're in a desert, walking along in the sand, when all of a sudden you look down.."More human than human" is our motto. That Voight-Kampf test of yours. Did you ever tried to take that test yourself? Deckard? Remember when you were six? You and your brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window. You were going to play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your turn you chickened and ran; you remember that? You ever tell anybody that? Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? Remember the spider that lived outside your window? Orange body, green legs. Watched her build a web all summer, then one day there's a big egg in it. The egg hatched...Implants. Those aren't your memories, they're somebody else's. They're Tyrell's niece's.
                    Deckard: [he sees that she's deeply hurt by the implication] O.K., bad joke... I made a bad joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, O.K.? No, really - I'm sorry, go home.Ladies and gentlemen... Taffey Lewis presents... Miss Salome and the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent... that once corrupted man.</div>
